# EllipticBlendingKOmega
This project aims at implementing the k-omega Lag Elliptic Blending turbulent model for OpenFOAM. 

## Software requirements
The model has been developed and tested in [OpenFOAM v2212](https://www.openfoam.com/download/release-history#v2212).


## Usage

### Model source code
In the folder ```kOmegaLagEB``` you can find the implementation of the model in OpenFOAM.
